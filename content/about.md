I am currently pursiuing my doctoral studies at the Institute of Plant Genetics at the Heinrich-Heine Universität in Düsseldorf, Germany. I am studing the the ecological genetics of natural populations of <i>Hordeum murinum murinum</i> in Europe. 

Also, below is an overview of my educational and professional work history.

I am also giving pro bono lectures on the use of R for data analysis for agriculture students, especially plant breeding major students, at Central Mindanao Univeristy. I believe that Filipino students should not be reliant on University statisticians to analyze their data because it limits their creativity and/or intuition to maximize their data which may able them to present to information. By teaching them to use R, hopefully, they became empowered to properly analyze their data or even design their undergraduate experiments better.
